                    I am a senior at Colorado College studying computer science with a minor
                    in statistics. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence and
                    large language models. In 2023, I completed a ten-week cybersecurity research
                    project at Montana State University, where I investigated the movement and detection
                    of malicious packets through a network. In my free time, I am an amateur photographer
                    and have coded and published a website working as a portfolio for my work.
